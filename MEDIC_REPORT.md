# MEDIC REPORT — 2026-04-24T00:00 UTC

## Status: API UNREACHABLE — Cannot Assess Bot Health (Persistent Issue — Run #17)

## Environment
- Run timestamp: 2026-04-24T00:00 UTC
- Medic agent: NVR Capital autonomous agent (hourly run)
- Working directory: /home/user/autonomous-trading-bot
- Current branch: claude/cool-sagan-gfMja

## Problem

The bot production API at `https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app` is **completely unreachable** from this execution environment.

All endpoints attempted returned `403 Forbidden`:

```
curl -s https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/errors
→ 403 Forbidden

curl -s https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/balances
→ 403 Forbidden

curl -s https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/health
→ 403 Forbidden
```

GeckoTerminal API also blocked (same egress restriction):
```
GET https://api.geckoterminal.com/api/v2/networks/base/trending_pools?page=1
→ 403 Forbidden
```

## Root Cause

The Claude Code execution sandbox has an **egress proxy** that only allows outbound connections to a fixed allowlist of domains. The Railway deployment domain and third-party APIs are **not on this allowlist**. This is a **persistent infrastructure constraint** — it does NOT indicate a bot failure.

## Bot Health Evidence (from git history)

The staging branch is extremely active with autonomous updates. Most recent staging commits include:

- `fix(pnl): tighten daily-pnl phantom filter` — catch 1:1 fallback signatures
- `fix(pnl): per-trade phantom filter on daily-pnl rollup` (v21.20.1 follow-on)
- `fix(pnl): per-token phantom realized cleanup` (v21.20.1)
- Merge fix/realized-pnl-poison-2026-04-18 into staging
- Merge fix/payout-accrual-2026-04-22 into staging
- Merge fix/trade-counter-reconcile into staging
- `fix(payout): accrue pendingFeeUSDC in CDP sell path + separate execution date`
- `fix(pnl): two-layer realized-P&L sanitizer + startup re-sync + audit endpoint`
- `feat(cost): v21.20 prompt caching on heavy-cycle Sonnet calls + real telemetry cost math`

**The bot appears healthy** — staging is receiving active P&L fixes and cost optimizations.

Last scout ran: 2026-04-20T21:09 UTC (GHST added) — now >72h ago, Scout is due.

## What Is NOT Known

Because the API is unreachable, the medic cannot determine:
- Whether `summary.totalFailed / summary.totalAttempted > 0.5`
- Whether any error pattern (A/B/C) is active in `recentFailedTrades`
- Whether all circuit breakers are blocked
- Current portfolio balance or P&L state

## Jobs Status This Run (Run #17)

- **Medic**: PATTERN D — API unreachable (same persistent constraint). No code changes.
- **Scout**: RUNNING — last scout was 2026-04-20T21:09 UTC (>72h ago, past 48h threshold).
- **Auditor**: RUNNING — proceeding with web research since live metrics unavailable; will flag if trigger data inaccessible.

## Recommended Action for Henry

**This is the 17th consecutive run with the same network restriction. Action urgently required:**

1. **Add to Claude Code egress allowlist:**
   - `autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app`
   - `api.geckoterminal.com`
   - `api.dexscreener.com`
2. **Or** expose a read-only status webhook on an already-allowed domain
3. **Manually verify bot health:** https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/health
4. **IMPORTANT:** Staging branch has many queued improvements (v21.20+ P&L fixes). Consider promoting: `./scripts/deploy/stage.sh` → verify → `./scripts/deploy/promote.sh`

## Pattern Classification
PATTERN D — Unknown / Cannot Assess (API unreachable, persistent environmental constraint, not a trade-error pattern)

## Safety
- No code changes made to agent-v3.2.ts
- No production changes
- Report committed to feature branch per MEDIC SAFETY protocol
