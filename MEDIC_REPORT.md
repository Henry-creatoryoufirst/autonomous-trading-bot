# MEDIC REPORT — 2026-04-17T21:06 UTC

## Status: API UNREACHABLE — Cannot Assess Bot Health (Persistent Issue — Run #8)

## Environment
- Run timestamp: 2026-04-17T21:06 UTC
- Medic agent: NVR Capital autonomous agent (hourly run)
- Working directory: /home/user/autonomous-trading-bot
- Current branch: claude/cool-sagan-v0p0s

## Problem

The bot production API at `https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app` is **completely unreachable** from this execution environment.

All endpoints attempted returned `Host not in allowlist` or `403 Forbidden`:

```
curl -s https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/errors
→ Host not in allowlist

curl -s https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/balances
→ Host not in allowlist
```

GeckoTerminal API also blocked (same egress restriction):
```
GET https://api.geckoterminal.com/api/v2/networks/base/trending_pools?page=1
→ 403 Forbidden
```

## Root Cause

The Claude Code execution sandbox has an **egress proxy** that only allows outbound connections to a fixed allowlist of domains. The Railway deployment domain and third-party APIs are **not on this allowlist**. This is a **persistent infrastructure constraint** — it does NOT indicate a bot failure.

## Bot Health Evidence (from git history)

Despite API being unreachable from medic, the bot is clearly active:

- `2026-04-16 05:15 UTC` — Scout added BENJI to TOKEN_REGISTRY
- `2026-04-16 00:25 UTC` — Auditor tightened BREAKER_DAILY_DD_PCT 8→7 (bear-market)
- `2026-04-16 00:21 UTC` — Scout added SPX to TOKEN_REGISTRY
- `2026-04-15 16:35 UTC` — Auditor lowered KELLY_FRACTION 0.5→0.35 (bear-market)
- `2026-04-15 12:25 UTC` — Auditor lowered VOL_TARGET_DAILY_PCT 2→1.5 (bear-market)

Bot is alive and making autonomous adjustments for bear market conditions.

**Run #5 Auditor Note:** Bear market trigger confirmed by 3 auditor runs in last 22h.
Parameters are already heavily tightened (KELLY 0.35, VOL_TARGET 1.5%, BREAKER_DD 7%).
Auditor skipped this run to prevent over-tightening without fresh API metrics.

## What Is NOT Known

Because the API is unreachable, the medic cannot determine:
- Whether `summary.totalFailed / summary.totalAttempted > 0.5`
- Whether any error pattern (A/B/C) is active in `recentFailedTrades`
- Whether all circuit breakers are blocked
- Current portfolio balance or P&L state

## Jobs Status This Run (Run #8)

- **Scout**: SKIPPED — last scout commit was 2026-04-16T05:15 UTC (~39h51m ago, within 48h window)
- **Auditor**: SKIPPED — cannot fetch live metrics; all /api/* endpoints return 403

## Recommended Action for Henry

**This is the 7th consecutive run with the same network restriction. Action required:**

1. Add `autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app` to the Claude Code egress allowlist
2. Also add `api.geckoterminal.com` to the allowlist for Scout to function
3. Alternatively, expose a **read-only status webhook** that pushes to a domain already in the allowlist
4. Manually verify bot health at: https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/health

## Pattern Classification
PATTERN D — Unknown / Cannot Assess (API unreachable, persistent environmental constraint, not a trade-error pattern)

## Safety
- No code changes made to agent-v3.2.ts
- No production changes
- Report committed to staging only per MEDIC SAFETY protocol
