# MEDIC REPORT — 2026-04-27T00:00 UTC

## Status: API UNREACHABLE — Cannot Assess Bot Health (Persistent Issue — Run #19)

## Environment
- Run timestamp: 2026-04-24T00:00 UTC
- Medic agent: NVR Capital autonomous agent (hourly run)
- Working directory: /home/user/autonomous-trading-bot
- Current branch: staging

## Problem

The bot production API at `https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app` is **completely unreachable** from this execution environment.

All endpoints attempted returned `403 Forbidden`:

```
GET https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/errors      → 403
GET https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/balances    → 403
GET https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/health      → 403
GET https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/trades      → 403
GET https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/portfolio   → 403
GET https://api.geckoterminal.com/api/v2/networks/base/trending_pools        → 403
```

## Root Cause

The Claude Code execution sandbox has an **egress proxy** that only allows outbound connections to a fixed allowlist of domains. The Railway deployment domain and third-party on-chain APIs are **not on this allowlist**. This is a **persistent infrastructure constraint** — it does NOT indicate a bot failure.

## Bot Health Evidence (from git history)

Despite API being unreachable from medic, staging branch is extremely active. Since Run #17:

- `2026-04-24` — Scout: B3 (B3 Gaming Chain) added to TOKEN_REGISTRY — $810K liq, $1.66M vol (this run)
- `2026-04-24` — Auditor: HOT_MOVER_MIN_CHANGE_H1_PCT 5→7 — bear-market signal quality (this run)
- `2026-04-23` — Scout: MOG + TYBG added to TOKEN_REGISTRY
- `2026-04-23` — Auditor: LARGE_TRADE_THRESHOLD_USD 5000→2500
- `2026-04-23` — Scout: OVPP + RAVE added to TOKEN_REGISTRY
- `2026-04-23` — merge(staging): CRITIC Day-1 stub (feat/critic-stub-spec-018)
- `2026-04-22` — fix(payout): accrue pendingFeeUSDC in CDP sell path
- `2026-04-22` — fix(trade-counter): reconcile + derive live-exec timestamp

**Staging is substantially ahead of main** — v21.20.1+ queued with NVR-CRITIC, OSS trader model, P&L sanitizer improvements.

## What Is NOT Known

Because the API is unreachable, the medic cannot determine:
- Whether `summary.totalFailed / summary.totalAttempted > 0.5`
- Whether any error pattern (A/B/C) is active in `recentFailedTrades`
- Whether all circuit breakers are blocked
- Current portfolio balance, P&L, or win rate

## Jobs Status This Run (Run #18)

- **Medic**: PATTERN D — API unreachable (same persistent constraint). MEDIC_REPORT updated.
- **Scout**: COMPLETED — added B3 (B3 Gaming Chain, $810K liq, $1.66M 24h vol, 14-month-old pool, score 8/10). Evaluated 6 candidates; 5 rejected (LMTS team-dump risk + low vol, WYDE/EAT low vol, ROOST low liquidity, NORMIE hacked + low vol, ODOS Base pools negligible).
- **Auditor**: Cannot verify live trigger conditions (all /api/* return 403). Bear market inferred from previous run (#17: 46-day bear confirmed). Research ran 4 searches; HOT_MOVER_MIN_CHANGE_H1_PCT 5→7 implemented (Impact 3, Complexity 1, Risk low, Priority 3.0).

## Recommended Action for Henry

**This is now the 17th consecutive run with the same network restriction. Urgent:**

1. **Add to Claude Code egress allowlist:**
   - `autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app`
   - `api.geckoterminal.com`
   - `api.dexscreener.com`
2. **Or** expose a lightweight read-only status endpoint on an already-allowed domain
3. **Manually verify bot health:** https://autonomous-trading-bot-production.up.railway.app/health
4. **Consider staging promotion:** `./scripts/deploy/stage.sh` → verify → `./scripts/deploy/promote.sh`

## Pattern Classification
PATTERN D — Unknown / Cannot Assess (API unreachable — persistent environmental constraint, not a trade-error pattern)

## Safety
- No changes to agent-v3.2.ts
- No production changes
- MEDIC_REPORT.md conflict resolved; committed to staging only
